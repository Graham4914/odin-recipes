# odin-recipes
Its good to walk through some fundementals of seting up the enviroment and operating system and also using the cli.  After completing courses on codeacanamy and working on a few web pojects incuding my own business website, i am comortable with my knowledge and understanding of html, css, however i need to work on more projects to reinforce my knowledge and progress with deeper undertanding. Javascript on the otherhand is more challenging and id say i am familliar but not at all comfortbale with it.  I think working through the odin project will really help me develop my skils and fill in gaps of understanding that are important in a progrssive way.
